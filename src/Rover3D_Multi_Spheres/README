A Mars Rover with 21 DOF will run on the Fixed Spheres in 3D

Contact with the Spheres and frictions are considered.Visualization Generation code is also included.

The dynamical systems external input files are generated by Maple.

Part of code for post-treatment is also created by Maple.

To use this code to simulate the Rover,

1. in /src directory, load file "GenerateMode.mw" in Maple software. And run the code.
   The external plugin files will be created in C files.

2  Run the cpp code "Rover3D_Muulti_SphereVRML.cpp" in siconos. The result for 3D visualization and gnulot will be written.

3 Use a VRML player to visualize the result with the file "run.wrl"
  If you need more details of result data, load file "result.gp" in gnuplot. It will give a lot of useful information about the details of Rover operation.
