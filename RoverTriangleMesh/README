Simulation of a mars rover on a triangle mesh terrain

author: jan michalczyk

1) in pyTriangulation folder run script triang.py with a .txt file with points as an input

ex.: ./triang.py sample.txt

sample.txt should contain list of points to triangulate. Points should be arranged one point per line.
Space key is used as separator. Script will output a graph with triangulation plot and two files.

 1) SICout.txt which will be read by SICONOS.
 2) output.wrl which will be used to visualize the terrain in VRML.

After generating the mesh run the simulation.

ex.: siconos Rover3D_Multi_TriangleVRML.cpp

2) Check your output in run.wrl file.
