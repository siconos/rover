\section{Introduction}

This document contains specification and documentation of the tests performed 
on the Exomars rover model using Siconos software. Model has been created using HuMAnS software and implemented using its C code generator. 
The intention thereof is a common reference and unification of mechanical tests of the exomars rover across different platforms. As of now, seven tests have been performed:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Rover stabilization on a horizontal plane after a free-fall phase.\\[1mm]
        In the first test setting the rover falls freely from the height of 2 meters onto a horizontal plane.
        No torques are applied in any of the joints. The only external forces acting on the rover are
        the gravity and the ground reaction forces. Initial position of the rover has been set to (x, y, z) = (5, 5, 2) [m].
        Friction coefficient has been set to 0.7. This case has been divided into two sub-cases: first one with the normal restituion coefficient set to zero and
        the second one with the normal restitution coefficient set to 0.2. Tangential restitution coefficients have been set to zero in both sub-cases. 
  
  \item Rover stabilization on a horizontal plane with linearly varying velocity of one steering axis.\\[1mm]
        In the second test setting rover is dropped onto a horizontal plane and stands idle on it during the first 50 seconds of the simulation.
        After 50 seconds from the beginning of the simulation a constant torque $\tau = 0.00002Nm$ is applied in one of the steering axes (steering axis FL)
        causing its rotational motion with linear velocity. Wheel makes two full rotations around its vertical steering axis (FL). 
        Other external forces acting on the rover are the gravity and ground reaction. Initial position of the center of mass of the robot
        has been set to (x, y, z) = (5, 5, 2) [m]. Friction coefficient has been set to 0.4. Restitution coefficients (tangential and normal) have been set to zero.
        
  \item Rover stabilization on a horizontal plane with acceleration and deceleration phases.\\[1mm]
        In the third test setting rover's parcour is divided into six time intervals with different values of torques applied to the wheels:

        \begin{itemize} 
          \item $0s < t_s < 20s$, $\tau = 0Nm$           
          \item $20s < t_s < 40s$, $\tau = 0.0007Nm$        
          \item $40s < t_s < 80s$, $\tau = 0Nm$         
          \item $80s < t_s < 105s$, $\tau = -0.0007Nm$
          \item $105s < t_s < 150s$, $\tau = 0Nm$         
          \item $150s < t_s < 200s$, $\tau = -0.0005Nm$ 
        \end{itemize}

        \noindent Other external forces acting on the rover are the gravity and ground reactions. Initial position of the center of mass of the robot
        has been set to (x, y, z) = (5, 8, 0.57) [m]. In the $5^{th}$ phase rover effectively stops its motion until negative torques are applied.
        Friction coefficient has been set to 0.7. Restitution coefficients (tangential and normal) have been set to zero. 

  \item Rover stabilization on an inclined plane with a phase of upwards motion.\\[1mm]
        In the fourth test setting rover is set to stand steadily on an inclined plane.   
        Inclination angle of the slope has been set to 10$^\circ$. Torques applied to the wheels counterbalance torques caused by
        the gravity. After initial period higher torques are applied to the wheels which cause the robot to drive upwards. Blocking torques are equal to  
        $\tau_{b} = -0.87072Nm$. During the second phase of motion linearly varying torques are applied to all wheels.\\[1mm] 
        \noindent Rover's parcour has been devided into two phases:

        \begin{itemize} 
          \item $0s < t_s < 30s$, $\tau_{b}$ $-$  $constant$ $blocking$ $torques$           
          \item $30s < t_s < 40s$, $\tau_{m}$ $-$ $linearly$ $increasing$ $torques$        
        \end{itemize}

        Friction coefficient has been set to 0.8. Restitution coefficients (tangential and normal) have been set to zero. 

  \item Rover stabilization on an inclined plane with acceleration and deceleration phases.\\[1mm]
        In the fifth test setting rover is dropped onto the inclined plane.
        Inclination angle of the slope has been set to 10$^\circ$. After the 10$^{th}$ second of motion a simple PD controller
        is set using position and velocity of the center of mass in order to stop the rover on the slope. Rover stops effectively at $t = 25s$.
        Friction coefficient has been set to 0.8. Restitution coefficients (tangential and normal) have been set to zero. 

  \item Spherical obstacle crossing on a horizontal plane.\\[1mm] 
        In the sixth test setting rover is dropped onto the horizontal plane from the height of $2$ $m$. After $10$ $s$ linearly varying torques are applied to all wheels. 
        A spherical obstacle has been set in front of the rover. The obstacle is in the form of a sphere which protudes outside the plane.
        Center of the sphere has been set so that the protrusion is equal to $20$ $cm$. Coefficients of friction and restitution (normal) are in this case respectively:
        0.3 and 0. 

  \item Vertical step obstacle crossing.\\[1mm]
        In the seveth test setting rover is dropped onto a horizontal plane.
        An obstacle in the form of a horizontal step of height $0.1m$ (roughly equal to the wheel radius) has been set in front of the rover.
        At certain point of time ($t$ $=$ $10s$) rover starts moving towards the step and crosses it mounting on the higher plane.
        Friction coefficient has been set to 0.6. Restitution coefficient (normal) has been set to 0.1. 

\end{enumerate}

\noindent Results of each of the above tests  will be detailed in the following sections.\\[1mm]
\noindent In mechanical simulations with nonsmooth approach one is mostly interested in the following quantities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $x_{COM}$ - mass center coordinates
  \item $x_{wheels}$ - wheels angular displacement 
  \item $v_{COM}$ - mass center velocity
  \item $v_{wheels}$ - wheels angular velocity
  \item $R$ - reaction forces (impulsions) in lagrangian (global) coordinates
  \item $\lambda_{N}$ ($\lambda_{\bar{n}}$) - normal component of the contact force (impulsion) in local coordinates
  \item $\lambda_{T_x}$ ($\lambda_{\bar{t}}$) - tangential component of the contact force (impulsion) in local coordinates in the x direction
  \item $\lambda_{T_z}$ ($\lambda_{\bar{s}}$) - tangential component of the contact force (impulsion) in local coordinates in the z direction
  \item $y_{N}$ ($y_{\bar{n}}$) - gap function (distance between contact point and the constraint function)
  \item $\dot{y}_{N}$ ($\dot{y}_{\bar{n}}$) - normal component of the local contact velocity
  \item $\dot{y}_{T_x}$ ($\dot{y}_{\bar{t}}$) - tangential component x of the local contact velocity
  \item $\dot{y}_{T_z}$ ($\dot{y}_{\bar{s}}$) - tangential component z of the local contact velocity
\end{itemize}

\noindent For each scenario a subset of the above quantities has been plotted.\\
